## Architecture Overview

The system follows a separated frontend/backend architecture where Next.js handles user interface and user experience while NestJS manages business logic and data operations.
Communication occurs through RESTful APIs with JSON payloads, enabling independent scaling and deployment of each service.

## Deployment Strategy

**Frontend Deployment**: Vercel for Next.js application hosting with automatic deployments from GitHub
**Backend Deployment**: Railway or Render for NestJS API hosting with PostgresSQL database
**Database**: Managed PostgresSQL instance with automated backups and scaling
**CDN**: Integrated CDN through Vercel for static asset optimization

## Alternative Considerations

### Alternatives Evaluated and Rejected

**Create React App vs Next.js**: While CRA provides simpler setup, it lacks the server-side rendering and performance optimizations essential for e-commerce SEO and user experience.

**Express.js vs NestJS**: Express offers more flexibility but requires significant architectural decisions that could lead to inconsistent patterns. NestJS provides structure that accelerates learning and development.

**MongoDB vs PostgresSQL**: While MongoDB offers development simplicity, the complex relationships in e-commerce data benefit from relational database capabilities and ACID compliance.

** Custom Authentication vs NextAuth.js**: Building custom authentication would provide learning value but introduce security risks and development time that outweigh the educational benefits.
